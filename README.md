# Cisco Cyber Operations Scholarship Collaborative Blueprint

Your help is needed! The purpose of this repo is to provide a single point that everyone in our cohort can use to create one master blueprint. I will keep this repo up to date as I progress through the certification but it is my hope that more people will contribute. Once you have made a contribution please create a pull request. Let's help each other out and ensure no one is left behind.
